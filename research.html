                    <p> JWST has revealed an unexpectedly large number of bright galaxy candidates at z > 10. To explain these observations, we explored how the stellar initial mass function (IMF) might vary with galaxy properties and redshift. We tested an IMF that becomes increasingly top-heavy in gas-rich galaxies with high specific star formation rates. Implemented within the <a href="codes.html#astraeus">ASTRAEUS</a> framework, this evolving IMF successfully reproduces the observed galaxy counts at z = 5–15. Crucially, the luminosity boost is strongest in galaxies where star formation is not strongly limited by supernova feedback. While the evolving IMF has little effect on the late stages of reionisation, it triggers an earlier onset, potentially explaining how some z ~ 13 galaxies already show observable Lyman-alpha emission. </p>

                    <p> Observations with JWST have revealed an unexpected high abundance of bright z>10 galaxy candidates. We explore whether a stellar initial mass function (IMF) that becomes increasingly top-heavy towards higher redshifts and lower gas-phase metallicities results in a higher abundance of bright objects in the early universe and how it affects the evolution of galaxy properties compared to a constant IMF. We incorporate such an evolving IMF into the <a href="codes.html#astraeus">ASTRAEUS</a> framework that couples galaxy evolution and reionisation in the first billion years. Our implementation accounts for the IMF dependence of supernova feedback, metal enrichment, ionising and ultraviolet radiation emission. We conduct two simulations: one with a Salpeter IMF and one with the evolving IMF. Our results suggest that a top-heavier IMF alone is unlikely to explain the higher abundance of bright z>10 sources, since the lower mass-to-light ratio is counteracted by the stronger stellar feedback. </p>

                    <p> We examine how the cross-correlation functions between 21-cm emission from neutral hydrogen and Lyman-alpha radiation-emitting galaxies (Lyman-alpha emitters) depend on the reionisation history, topology, and simulated volume. We develop an analytic expression for the 21cm-LAE cross-correlation function and compare it with results from <a href="codes.html#astraeus">ASTRAEUS</a> and 21cmFAST reionisation simulations covering a physically plausible range of scenarios where either the low-mass or more massive galaxies drive reionisation. Our results show that the small-scale cross-correlation amplitude depends on the intergalactic medium's average neutral hydrogen fraction and spin-temperature weighted overdensity in neutral regions, while the cross-correlation function's inversion point traces the peak of the size distribution of ionised regions around Lyman-alpha emitters. This makes 21cm-LAE cross-correlations sensitive to both the reionisation history and topology. </p>

                    <p> We extend the <a href="codes.html#astraeus">ASTRAEUS</a> simulations by a new model for Lyman-alpha emitters for the two physically plausible bracketing scenarios of the escape fraction of ionising photons increasing and decreasing with rising halo mass. Our new model parameterises results from numerical Lyman-alpha radiative transfer simulations and introduces novel analytic Lyman-alpha line profile models that describe the surrounding interstellar medium as outflowing dusty gas clumps, with one of them relating the escape fraction of Lyman-alpha photons to that of ionising photons. We find that during reionisation Lyman-alpha emitters are relatively massive galaxies residing in overdense and highly ionised regions. For this reason, their spatial distribution is primarily sensitive to the global ionisation fraction and only eakly to the ionisation topology or a halo mass dependent escape fraction of ionising photons. </p>

                    <p> 21cm-LAE cross correlations can provide a relative robust measurements of the IGM neutral hydrogen fraction during reionization, but low observational uncertainties will be key for detecting this cross correlation signal. However, the reduction of the uncertainties arising from the 21cm signal measurements and the LAE observations favour opposite survey designs. While the uncertainties in the 21cm signal detection are reduced by larger survey volumes, the shot noise arising from the finite number of LAEs decreases with the survey limiting Ly&alpha; luminosity, the faintest detectable Ly&alpha; luminosity, demanding for deeper observations. In this paper, we pursue the question of which survey design (i.e. survey volume versus limiting Lyα luminosity) would be optimal and feasible to minimise the 21cm-LAE cross correlation uncertainties. </p>

                    <p> We study the signatures of reionization and ionizing properties of early galaxies in the cross-correlations between the 21 cm emission from the spin-flip transition of neutral hydrogen and the underlying galaxy population. With LAEs occupying the densest and most-ionized regions, the anti-correlation between the LAEs and the 21 cm emission is the strongest and provides an indicator of the ionization level of the intergalactic medium that will be detectable with SKA. We also find that detecting a lower 21cm brightness temperature (by about 2-10 mK) in the densest regions (≳2 arcmin scales) hosting LAEs, compared to lower-density regions devoid of LAEs, is a measurable tracing an inside-out reionization topology. </p>
